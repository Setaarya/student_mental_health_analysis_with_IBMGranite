            "1. **Screen Time and Stress Level:** The dataset indicates a potential correlation between increased screen time and higher stress levels.

This trend is particularly pronounced in males, though females also exhibit elevated stress with high screen time.\n",

This trend is consistent across various age groups and education levels, suggesting a potential negative impact of excessive screen use on academic outcomes.\n",

            "\n",
            "4. **Age-Related Variations:** Younger individuals (15-20 years) seem to have higher screen times, which correlate with medium stress levels and mixed academic outcomes. Older students and young adults (21-26 years) also demonstrate high screen times, but with a clearer pattern of stress and declining academic performance.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Prioritize Sleep**: The data suggests that students who get more sleep (7.2 hrs or more) tend to have lower anxiety levels (\"Anxious Before Exams\") and better academic performance. For instance, individuals with 7.2 hours of sleep or more (e.g., Male, 22, BSc; Female, 15, Class 8) show either no anxiety or improved performance, whereas those with less sleep often exhibit higher anxiety or declining academic performance. **Recommendation**: Encourage students to establish a regular sleep schedule, create a conducive sleep environment, and avoid screens before bedtime to enhance sleep quality.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Engage in Regular Physical Activity**: Students with higher physical activity levels (4.2 hrs or more per week) demonstrate lower anxiety levels and improved academic performance. Examples include Male, 17, Class 11 (9.1 hours) and Female, 15, Class 8 (10 hours). **Recommendation**: Promote the integration of physical exercise into daily routines, whether through sports, gym activities, or even walking. This can help reduce stress hormones and increase the production of endorphins, which are natural mood lifters.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Manage Screen Time**: Excessive screen time (8.0 hrs/day or more) correlates with higher anxiety levels and sometimes poorer academic performance. Students with high screen times, such as Male, 25, MA (10.5 hrs) and Female, 16, Class 10 (10.4 hrs), often report higher anxiety, even if their academic performance remains unchanged. **Recommendation**: Advise students to set limits on daily screen time, take regular breaks from digital devices, and engage in offline activities or hobbies to mitigate the adverse effects of excessive screen use on mental health.\n",
            "\n",
            "These recommendations are grounded in the dataset's patterns and are supported by established research on stress management and mental well-being. Implementing these\n"
